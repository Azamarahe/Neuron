1. if any cells accelerate, move them independently of their bodies. move bodies and cells.
2. detect collisions, apply velocities assuming free cells.
3. project as if free. 
4. detect collisions, apply velocities assuming free cells. (should be a minimum distance constraint, so force eventually dies out)
5. when collisions end, 



option: store attachment strength vector? if impulse is greater than that,
