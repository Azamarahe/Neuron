new system: top-down nested calls

sensor value is dependant on location...
how to implement this? 

for each sensor (with function level), (in organism) 
get spectrum value in span at location



sensor genes are sensor prototypes. sensor functions are stored here. 

sensors in organism store function level and Sensor protoype


need to rename Sensor to Sensor_Type?

decision: remember above as an option, but currently the feature is not needed. 


does world field value access need to be a function, or can it be data?
data seems less secure...


in brain transcription,
create a virtual neuron


in brain transcription, each layer should be composed of neurons for which all inputs are in one of the previous layers...


cutest way would be if Value(), when called by a sensor, translates to
